# Luxury_Hotel_Website
My university project website created only with HTML and CSS.
I'll be honest, I was just trying to pass the class, not create a big website, so don't expect fancy code or page structure.

The page structure is divided into three parts: Top; Mid & Under
First, the "Top". It include the search menu (Only navegations options, no search bar) and a cropped background image with a brief description of the selected page's topic.
Second, the "Mid". It's in the middle of the page and contains all the stuff related to the topic.
Third, the "Under". It's just the end with information and another navigation menu.

I tried to create a txt file with the authors of the photos I used in the project, but I didn't finish it.

feel free to use any part of the code.

English language is not my maternal language, for that reason, if you see some spanish words in the code, just translate to english.
